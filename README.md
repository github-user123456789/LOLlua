<h1>HELLO</h1>

THIS IS STUPID IDIOT LOLCAT code BUt its lua
it is based off of a language on an esolang wiki: https://esolangs.org/wiki/LOLScript
                                                  you should go to this link because it is important because it tells you the lolscript equivalent of lua keywords
                                                  if you are a stupid loser you can also use normal lua keywords but thats not fun so dont plz

and i am a noob so i only support strings with " and ' but you can try [[]] and [==[]==] if you want to
but your stupid lolcat comment might get turned into lua keywords

MAKE SURE TO USE IN ALL OF YOUR:
  - professional code
  - games
  - game engines
  - roblox script builders for noobs
  - core
  - sonic robo blast 2
  - garry's mod
  - anything with lua

BUT WAIT OOPS i used luau stuff so you have to change that

To use just call the loadstring function ya ya ya
